# Full Stack Project - Frontend

This repository holds the frontend code for a full-stack application designed to showcase modern web development practices and provide a rich user interface.

## Project Overview

The frontend of this project is built using [React.js](https://reactjs.org/), styled with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for responsive design, and uses [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) for state management. This combination ensures a robust, scalable, and maintainable architecture that can be easily extended with additional features.

## Features

- Responsive UI compatible with various devices.
- Dynamic interaction with backend services.
- User authentication and authorization.
- Real-time data handling.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js (version 14 or later recommended)
- npm (Node Package Manager)

### Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/barmor12/FullStack_Project_Frontend.git
   cd FullStack_Project_Frontend
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```
   npm install
   ```
3. **Run the development server:**
   ```
